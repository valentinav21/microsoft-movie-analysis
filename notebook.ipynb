    "### 1.1 Company Vision & High Level Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft's decision to venture into the movie industry marks an exciting strategic shift. By telling compelling stories through film, Microsoft can connect with audiences on an emotional level and establish a stronger presence in popular culture, leading to increased brand awareness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other tech companies, such as Apple and Amazon, have succesfully transitioned into the entertainment industry. By leveraging its extensive technological expertise, vast resources, and global reach, Microsoft can produce high-quality movies that will enhance its brand image and increase its cultural influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research seeks to use the available data to gain valuable insights into trends and consumption patterns, enabling the company to create tailored content that resonates with viewers and maximizes box office success. Within this notebook, I will explore what types of films Microsoft should make to maximize profitability and create positive brand exposure by producing critically acclaimed films. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Film Industry Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The period that this analysis will focus on starts from the New Hollywood Era. The New Hollywood era, spanning the late 1960s to the 1970s, was marked by auteur-driven filmmaking. High recognizable directors like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg emerged during this time period and are still relevant today. The era produced groundbreaking films like \"The Godfather,\" \"Taxi Driver,\" and \"Jaws,\" which not only achieved critical acclaim but also achieved significant commercial success.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1980s and 1990s, the blockbuster era took hold, with studios increasingly focusing on  films designed to attract large audiences and generate substantial profits. Directors like James Cameron and Steven Spielberg emerged and became synonymous with blockbuster filmmaking. \"Titanic\", which was directed by James Cameron, became the first billion dollar movie. It also won multiple awards, including an Oscar for Best Picture. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the 21st century, franchises, established intellectial properties (IPs), and cinematic universes are prevalent. Recognizable IPs such as Marvel and Star Wars series domanite the box office, attracting massive audiences and generating billions of dollars in revenue. Other IPs, such as Lego, Barbie, and Nintendo, have also plunged into filmmaking and have seen great success. These blockbusters often combine action, visual effects, and interconnected storytelling to create immersive cinematic experiences. However, strong independent voices in non-franchise cinema exist, with the likes of filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson. Prestige film awards, such as the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes, and the Cannes Film Festival, are also highly regarded in the industry and in popular culture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Research Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above goals and industry background, this analysis will focus on the following topics:\n",
    "- Limit analysis to films released between 1969 and 2019.\n",
    "- Investigate the types of films that produce high ROIs. \n",
    "- Find directors with experience creating either high ROI, high prestige films, or both. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in!"

    "This analysis uses a variety of trusted data sources. The datasets will be used to narrow down how Microsoft should  invest in its filmaking efforts. The sources are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IMDB:** Launched in 1990 - and owned by Amazon since 1998 - IMDB is one of the most popular and recognizable databases. This database houses a large amount of information such as directors, writers, genres, and release date.  \n",
    "- **The Numbers:** This database was started in 1997, and is now the largest freely available database of movie business information. The available data contains information about movie titles, production budgets, and gross revenue data. \n",
    "- **The Academy Awards**: This data was created by scraping the <a href=\"https://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/\">academy database</a> for a Kaggle competition. The Academy Awards is considered the most prestigious filmaking award in America, and this data will provide valuable insights in identifying individuals capable of making prestige films. This dataset contains information on Academy Award nominees and winners between the years 1927 and 2023. Access the data <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/the-oscar-award\">here</a> .  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is limited by the information in these datasets, and may not fully encompass the full scope of the filmaking industry. However, the data is current enough that this analysis can still provide valuable insight and guide Microsoft on their next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this analysis is to understand the data and how we can transform it to gleam insights. First, I am importing the necessary libraries to read the data and perform the necessary analysis. I will review the data sources one by one to determine what needs to be done before we can perform analysis. "
