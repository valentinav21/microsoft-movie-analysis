By leveraging its extensive technological expertise, vast resources, and global reach, Microsoft can produce high-quality movies can will enhance Microsoft's brand image and increase its cultural influence.\n",

    "This research seeks to use the available data to gain valuable insights into trends and consumption patterns, enabling the company to create tailored content that resonates with viewers and maximizes box office success. Within this notebook, we will explore what types of films Microsoft should make to maximize not just its return on investment but also positive brand exposure by producing critically acclaimed films. \n",

    "- What kind of films have a high ROI? Which genres, directors, actors, and writers have procuded films with high ROIs? \n",
    "- Which directors, actors, and writers have experience creating high-prestige films?\n",

    "This analysis uses a variety of trusted data sources. The datasets will be used to narrow down how Microsoft should  invest in its filmaking efforts. The sources are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IMDB:** Launched in 1990 - and owned by Amazon since 1998 - IMDB is one of the most popular and recognizable databases. This database houses a large amount of information such as directors, writers, genres, and release date.  \n",
    "- **The Numbers:** This database was started in 1997, and is now the largest freely available database of movie business information. The available data contains information about movie titles, production budgets, and gross revenue data. \n",
    "- **The Academy Awards, 1927-2015**: This dataset was provided by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences for a Kaggle competition. The Academy Awards is considered the most prestigious filmaking award in America, and this data will provide valuable insights in identifying individuals capable of making prestige films. This dataset, as the title suggests, contains information on Academy Award nominees and winners between the years 1927 anf 2015. Access the data <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theacademy/academy-awards?select=database.csv\">here</a> .  \n",

    "The first step in this analysis is to understand the data and how we can transform it to gleam insights. First, I am importing the necessary libraries to read the data and perform the necessary analysis.
